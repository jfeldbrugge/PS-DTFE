# Phase-Space Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator

The density and velocity fields of an N-body simulation can be reconstructed with the Phase-Space Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator implemented in a Python module. This code accompanies the publication [Phase-Space Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator](https://pages.github.com/). Please cite this publication when using the published code.

Besides the Phase-Space Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator, the module enables the evaluation of the traditional Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator and the traditional Phase-Space estimator. See the above-mentioned paper for a brief explanation of these methods and references to the papers where these techniques were first developed.

The current implementation uses the numpy, math and scipy modules in Python 3.12, though the code will likely run without much trouble in earlier versions.
